                <p>Here are some famous basslines from songs that should be fairly well known but are still great:</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxVw7bvMd3s">Feel Good Inc - Gorillaz</a> - it's a good bassline sir</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi_XLOBDo_Y">Billie Jean - Michael Jackson</a> - it's a good bassline sir</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dm_5qWWDV8">Hysteria - Muse</a> - this is harder to play than it sounds</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t2ioP2tu3E">Is This It - The Strokes</a> - I like the stuff starting around 0:54</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I">Get Lucky - Daft Punk</a> - this bassline is mostly good because it sounds good

                <p>Here are some less famous songs that I like. Not for everyone. But I have very good taste in basslines, so they are pretty good.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNsSBhl_2LI">Lauren - Men I Trust</a> - it's a good bassline sir</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJCB1ZlseJ8">Show Me How - Men I Trust</a> - good bassline and also good chords. This combination is creating shareholder value
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8QnKWPYRCs">Giant Steps - John Coltrane</a> - the bass is like a very competent guard dog here</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Z7USWo2Lk">Maps - Emancipator</a> - triphop/downtempo songs generally have good basslines, because they can't go hog wild with the percussion or the guitars
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrrXSaLW8Wg">Laser - Roman Tam</a> - dance song. With lasers</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0TXIXTzJEY">Il Vento d'Oro - Yugo Kanno</a> - the whole song is kind of wild but in a friendly way</p>
