                <p>In my <a href="preferencechanging.html">previous article on preference changing</a>, I described a method for changing likes and dislikes that takes weeks of practice. This article explores a faster approach I've been testing for several years.</p>

                <h3>What I've Discovered</h3>

                <p>I've found that when I focus my mind in certain ways, I can sometimes change my preferences much faster than normal. While this has worked well for me, I should note that it might be due to the placebo effect or other factors I'm not aware of.</p>

                <p>When I clearly define what I want to change and make sure it fits with my core values, I can shift preferences that would normally take weeks in a much shorter time. I've used this for everything from changing food preferences to how I react in social situations.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>

                <p>This approach uses four main psychological principles:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mental conflict resolution</strong> - Your brain naturally tries to resolve contradicting beliefs</li>
                    <li><strong>Focused attention</strong> - Directing your awareness to specific thoughts</li>
                    <li><strong>Mind state techniques</strong> - Changing preferences when your mind is in a receptive state</li>
                    <li><strong>Using both fast and slow thinking</strong> - Working with both your automatic reactions and conscious thoughts</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This method borrows ideas from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Therapy techniques that change thinking patterns</li>
                    <li>Research on how our brains can rewire themselves</li>
                    <li>Meditation practices that make your thinking more flexible</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Step-by-Step Process</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Get clear on what you want:</strong> Spend about 30 minutes thinking and writing about exactly what preference you want to change and why. Write down your current preference, your desired preference, and your reasons for making this change.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Check if it aligns with your values:</strong> Make sure the change fits with who you really are and what matters to you. If there's a conflict between your goal and your deeper values, the technique won't work well.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Learn to control your attention:</strong> The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/410600.Instant_Self_Hypnosis">"Instant Self Hypnosis"</a> by Forbes Blair teaches simple techniques, or you can use any good guide to meditation or self-hypnosis. The goal is to reach a calm, focused state where your mind becomes more flexible.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Practice holding opposing ideas:</strong> Read the essay <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-logic-of-buddhist-philosophy-goes-beyond-simple-truth">"Beyond true and false"</a> by Graham Priest. It discusses how some contradictions can be true. You don't need to believe this philosophically, but practicing this kind of flexible thinking helps with preference changing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>How to Apply It</h3>
                
                <p>When you're ready to change a specific preference:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Get into a relaxed, focused state (like light meditation)</li>
                    <li>Picture both your current preference and your desired preference at the same time</li>
                    <li>Don't try to force anything - just observe how these two ideas interact in your mind</li>
                    <li>Pay attention to any tension or sense of resolution that naturally emerges</li>
                    <li>Let your mind integrate these perspectives in its own way</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Timing:</strong> While I've sometimes experienced quick changes using this method, most people should expect changes to happen over days or weeks, not instantly. Deeply ingrained preferences take longer to shift than newer ones.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Best uses:</strong> This works better for preferences that are primarily mental, like food tastes you've developed, rather than things that are strongly biological or hardwired.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ethical note:</strong> Only use this technique for changes that genuinely make your life better and feel authentic to you. Trying to force changes that go against your true self usually backfires.</p>

                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This is not a replacement for professional help. If you're dealing with addiction, eating disorders, or other serious issues, please seek appropriate professional support.</p>
                
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                
                <p>I'm sharing this experimental approach because it's been valuable to me, though there isn't much scientific research on rapid preference change yet. If you try it, I'd love to hear about your results - both successes and failures - as I continue to learn more about how we can change our preferences more efficiently.</p>
                
                <p>Think of this as an invitation to thoughtful experimentation rather than a guaranteed method. Our minds can change in surprising ways, and I believe we're just beginning to understand what's possible.</p>
