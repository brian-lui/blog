                <p>It's very simple: when you're an absolute beginner, work super hard to learn it. Learn from anything and everything that you can get your hands on. Try out different things, iterate rapidly.</p>

                <p>Keep on working hard and developing expertise, until you've internalized the core patterns in your field. Then, you can coast. Learning will become easier and faster, almost effortless.</p>

                <h2>When can I coast?</h2>

                <p>When you can confidently distinguish between good advice and bad advice.</p>
